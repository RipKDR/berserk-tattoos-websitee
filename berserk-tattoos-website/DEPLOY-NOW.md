## Step 5: Update Domain in netlify.toml (IMPORTANT)

The netlify.toml file has a redirect rule that needs to be updated with your actual domain.

In the file `berserk-tattoos-website/netlify.toml`, find this section (around line 98):

```toml
[[redirects]]
  # Redirect www to non-www (or vice versa)
  from = "https://www.berserktattoos.com/*"
  to = "https://berserktattoos.com/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true
```

**Update it to:**

```toml
[[redirects]]
  # Redirect non-www to www
  from = "https://berserk-tattoos.com/*"
  to = "https://www.berserk-tattoos.com/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true
```

Then commit and push this change, or redeploy the site.
